We have seen tides of growth and decline during the voyage. But we endured everything, \
and here we are, as one of the fast-growing players, constantly striving to be better. \
It is always been the crew, their perseverance, and efforts, that lead us forward. \
And we never gave up on our mission, in fact, our mission steered our drive. \
We always ventured beyond the boundaries and explored the latest, our arsenal always \
filled with the advanced, and Blockchain is the latest in the list.\
A book like this is indeed a need of the hour, it is an aspiration of our research \
team; comprehending all the basics of blockchain in a single space to help those \
who wish to start with blockchain. Despite their tight R&D schedules, they have \
made incredible efforts to accomplish this work. In this occasion, I would like to \
express my sincere gratitude to all the team members who worked behind this \
work. And I wish the work be an excellent guide to all."
